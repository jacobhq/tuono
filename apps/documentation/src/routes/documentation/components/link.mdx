# Link

Tuono provides a `Link` component for clientside navigation between pages of your app. `Link` prefetches pages from any links above the fold, allowing for faster navigations without a full reload.

```typescript jsx
import { Link } from 'tuono'

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/page2">My Other Page</Link>
}
```

> Additional considerations:
>
> - Any `<Link />` in the viewport is prefetched by default when it appears within the viewport.
> - The corresponding data for server-rendered routes is fetched only when the `<Link />` is clicked.

## Reference

The `Link` component excepts the below optional props, as well as all those accepted by the HTML `a` tag.

- `preload`: `boolean` - Whether to preload the page if the link is within the viewport. Defaults to `true`.
- `scroll`: `boolean` - Whether to preserve scroll position between navigations. Defaults to `true`.
- `href`: `string` - Relative path to the page in your application. Anchor names (links with hashtags) are also valid.

The `Link` component uses [`router.push`](/documentation/hooks/use-router) under the hood.
